      <p>
        Use this panel to search for items in the loaded dataset. Search results
        will match the phrase used anywhere in the name of the item. For
        example, searching for <samp>N</samp> will match Nitrogen (
        <samp>N</samp>), but also Sodium (<samp>Na</samp>), Sodium Chloride (
        <samp>NaCl</samp>), and Potassium Azide (
        <samp>
          KN<sub>3</sub>
        </samp>
        ).
      </p>

      <h5>Pinning, Neighbors, and Subspaces</h5>

      <p>
        Next to the search results, you will see icons for <b>pinning</b>,{' '}
        <b>neighbors</b>, and <b>elemental subspace</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Pinning</i> an item maintains it in a list of items, so that you will
        not lose track of it while navigating the map. The list of pinned items
        appears as clickable badges below the search panel. You can click on the{' '}
        <i>neighbors</i> icon in order to additionally bring in the immediate
        neighbors of the pinned item. This provides an easy way to see an item's
        one-hop network without having to pin all of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, you can click on the <i>subspace</i> icon to add the item to
        the elemental subspace. This is a special collection of items that
        causes all materials containing any of the elements in it to appear. For
        instance, marking <samp>N</samp> and <samp>O</samp> for inclusion in the
        subspace will cause Nitrogen (<samp>N</samp>), Oxygen (<samp>O</samp>)
        to appear, but also Nitrogen Dioxide (
        <samp>
          NO<sub>2</sub>
        </samp>
        ) and Nitrous Oxide (
        <samp>
          N<sub>2</sub>O
        </samp>
        ), and any other compound made exclusively from nitrogen and oxygen
        atoms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Displaying neighbors and adding to a subspace both imply pinning. To
        remove either effect, you can click on the "X" on the pinned item's
        badge. Clicking again with go on to unpin the item as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pinned/neighbor/subpsace state of each material is also visible in
        the item detail panel, which can be opened by clicking on an item, or
        its pinned badge.
      </p>

      <p>
        These states can also be toggled by interacting with the map directly:
        <code>ctrl-click</code> will pin an item; <code>shift-click</code> will
        pin it and show neighbors; and <code>alt-click</code> will add its
        constituents to the subspace. You can also simply <i>select</i> an item
        by clicking on it without any keys pressed: while this opens the detail
        panel, it does not affect the item's pinned/neighbor/subspace status.
        Once the detail panel is open, you can also use the icons to affect that
        status for that item.

        This mode displays materials discovered <i>as of the selected year</i>
        in the "discovered" color, and all other materials in the "undiscovered
        color". By using this mode, then sweeping the discovery year slider, you

        Selecting this checkbox causes the map to only display nodes that have
        been pinned (including those that have been set to show neighbors, or
        that have been added to the element subspace). When nothing is pinned,
        the entire dataset will be displayed.

      <p>
        If this option is disabled, then unpinned items will be visible in a
        faded color in the background of the map. However, they can still be
        interacted with. When the option is enabled, these "hidden" items can be
        found by using the search box, or by activating the neighbors of pinned
        items, and then iteratively adding more neighbors to the display.

        This option will cause the display to temporarily hide all but the
        immediate neighbors of any selected item. Note that this is different
        from pinning an item together with its neighbors. This mode enables an
        exploration mode in which clicking on a neighbor also shows its one-hop
        neighborhood, which in turn may enable a progressive exploration further
        and further into the network from the original item.

      <p>
        LineUp provides a highly interactive experience: for example, controls
        in each column enable actions such as sorting the table by that column's
        values, construction of compound value columns by dragging and dropping
        one column onto another, etc. See the link above for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rows shown in the LineUp table can be clicked in order to select

        The "discovery year" slider also has a playback feature: when the play

        The <code>start</code> button kicks off a background worker that uses a
        force-based layout algorithm to flow the node of the graph around the
        map as though the links between them were springs pulling them closer
        together. Because this can be a costly operation, you may see more
        infrequent updates for larger subgraphs, but this is normal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once live layout begins, a <code>stop</code> button will appear;
        whenever you wish to pause the layout process, click this button. That
        will cause the
        <code>start</code> button to reappear, along with the "Reset" button.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>reset</code> button will restore the layout of the whole graph
        back to its original state.
